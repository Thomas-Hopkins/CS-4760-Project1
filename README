|- COMPILING -|
The provided Makefile will build both the logging utility
	static archive and the driver program and link them
	together. 
Simply run "make" and the "driver" executable will be 
	outputted. Run the driver executable to simulate how
	the logging utility would be used.
A cleaning function is provided. run "make clean" to clean up
	the directory and leave only src behind.
Make will also output the liblog.a static archive. This can
	be used in other programs by linking it.

TODO: Remove this if msggen included in driver
A small optional utility to generate fake logging messages 
	is also included. Compile this with "make msggen"
	./msggen will generate a text file with fake log
	messages to be used by the driver program.

|- USAGE -|
The driver program simulates a program that may utilize
	the logging utlity to log messages to a specified
	file.

The driver program has two optional arguements:
-t [sec] Specifies the average amount of time between
	messages the user wishes to simulate. The driver
	will randomly choose a time between 0-2*sec.
[filename] Specifies the output file the logging messages
	will be saved to. By default this is "filename".
