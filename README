|- COMPILING -|
The provided Makefile will build both the logging utility
	static archive and the driver program and link them
	together. 
Simply run "make" and the "driver" executable will be 
	outputted. Run the driver executable to simulate how
	the logging utility would be used.
A cleaning function is provided. run "make clean" to clean up
	the directory and leave only src behind.
Make will also output the liblog.a static archive. This can
	be used in other programs by linking it.

|- USAGE -|
The driver program simulates a program that may utilize
	the logging utlity to log messages to a specified
	file.

The driver program has two optional arguements:
-t [sec] Specifies the average amount of time between
	messages the user wishes to simulate. The driver
	will randomly choose a time between 0-2*sec.
[filename] Specifies the output file the logging messages
	will be saved to. By default this is "filename".

|- FUNCTIONALITY -|
The driver program will randomly generate a series of messages
	to be logged by the logging utility program.
The logging utility program will generate an internal list
	of these messages and save them out to a file when
	called to do so.

|- KNOWN ISSUES -|
Getlog currently does not properly return the log messages.
